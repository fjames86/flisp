.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall break a floating-point number \fInum\fP into
a normalized fraction and an integral power of 2. The
integer exponent shall be stored in the \fBint\fP object pointed to
by \fIexp\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
For finite arguments, these functions shall return the value \fIx\fP,
such that \fIx\fP has a magnitude in the interval
[0.5,1) or 0, and \fInum\fP equals \fIx\fP times 2 raised to the power
*\fIexp\fP.
.LP
If
\fInum\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned, and the value of *\fIexp\fP
is unspecified.
.LP
If \fInum\fP is \(+-0, \(+-0 shall be returned, and the value of *\fIexp\fP
shall be 0.
.LP
If \fInum\fP is \(+-Inf, \fInum\fP shall be returned, and the value
of *\fIexp\fP is unspecified. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
