.SH NAME
modf, modff, modfl - decompose a floating-point number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

.sp
double modf(double\fP \fIx\fP\fB, double *\fP\fIiptr\fP\fB);
.br
float modff(float\fP \fIvalue\fP\fB, float *\fP\fIiptr\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall break the argument \fIx\fP into integral and
fractional parts, each of which has the same sign as the
argument. It stores the integral part as a \fBdouble\fP (for the \fImodf\fP()
function), a \fBfloat\fP (for the \fImodff\fP()
function), or a \fBlong double\fP (for the \fImodfl\fP() function),
in the object pointed to by \fIiptr\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the signed
fractional part of \fIx\fP.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned, and *\fIiptr\fP shall be
set to a NaN.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-Inf, \(+-0 shall be returned, and *\fIiptr\fP shall
be set to \(+-Inf. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fImodf\fP() function computes the function result and *\fIiptr\fP
such that:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBa = modf(x, iptr) ;
x == a+*iptr ;
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
allowing for the usual floating-point inaccuracies.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
