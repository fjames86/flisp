.sp
double copysign(double\fP \fIx\fP\fB, double\fP \fIy\fP\fB);
.br
float copysignf(float\fP \fIx\fP\fB, float\fP \fIy\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall produce a value with the magnitude of \fIx\fP
and the sign of \fIy\fP. On implementations that represent
a signed zero but do not treat negative zero consistently in arithmetic
operations, these functions regard the sign of zero as
positive.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value with
the magnitude of \fIx\fP and the sign of \fIy\fP.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
