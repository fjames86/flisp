.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall compute the absolute value of their argument
\fIx\fP,| \fIx\fP|.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the absolute
value of \fIx\fP.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-0, +0 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned.
