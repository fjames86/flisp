.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall compute the principal value of the arc tangent
of \fIy\fP/ \fIx\fP, using the signs of both arguments to
determine the quadrant of the return value.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the arc tangent
of \fIy\fP/ \fIx\fP in the range [-,] radians.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is \(+-0 and \fIx\fP is < 0, \(+- shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is \(+-0 and \fIx\fP is > 0, \(+-0 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is < 0 and \fIx\fP is \(+-0, -/2 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is > 0 and \fIx\fP is \(+-0, /2 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is 0, a pole error shall not occur.
.LP
If
either \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If the result underflows, a range error may occur and \fIy\fP/ \fIx\fP
should be returned.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is \(+-0 and \fIx\fP is -0, \(+- shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is \(+-0 and \fIx\fP is +0, \(+-0 shall be returned.
.LP
For finite values of \(+- \fIy\fP > 0, if \fIx\fP is -Inf, \(+- shall
be
returned.
.LP
For finite values of \(+- \fIy\fP > 0, if \fIx\fP is +Inf, \(+-0 shall
be returned.
.LP
For finite values of \fIx\fP, if \fIy\fP is \(+-Inf, \(+-/2 shall
be
returned.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is \(+-Inf and \fIx\fP is -Inf, \(+-3/4 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIy\fP is \(+-Inf and \fIx\fP is +Inf, \(+-/4 shall be returned.
.LP
If both arguments are 0, a domain error shall not occur. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.TP
Range\0Error
The result underflows. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the underflow floating-point exception shall be
raised.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
