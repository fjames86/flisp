.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <math.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall compute the real cube root of their argument
\fIx\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the cube
root of \fIx\fP.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-0 or \(+-Inf, \fIx\fP shall be returned. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
For some applications, a true cube root function, which returns negative
results for negative arguments, is more appropriate
than \fIpow\fP( \fIx\fP, 1.0/3.0), which returns a NaN for \fIx\fP
less than 0.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
