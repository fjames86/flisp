.SH NAME
isnan - test for a NaN
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <math.h>
.br
.sp
int isnan(real-floating\fP \fIx\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
The \fIisnan\fP() macro shall determine whether its argument value
is a NaN. First, an argument represented in a format wider
than its semantic type is converted to its semantic type. Then determination
is based on the type of the argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIisnan\fP() macro shall return a non-zero value if and only
if its argument has a NaN value.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
