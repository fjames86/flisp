.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBj0()\fP and \fBj1()\fP functions return Bessel functions of \fIx\fP
of the first kind of orders 0 and 1, respectively.  The \fBjn()\fP function
returns the Bessel function of \fIx\fP of the first kind of order \fIn\fP.
.PP
The \fBy0()\fP and \fBy1()\fP functions return Bessel functions of \fIx\fP
of the second kind of orders 0 and 1, respectively.  The \fByn()\fP function
returns the Bessel function of \fIx\fP of the second kind of order \fIn\fP.
.PP
For the functions \fBy0()\fP, \fBy1()\fP and \fByn()\fP, the value of \fIx\fP
must be positive.  For negative values of \fIx\fP, these functions return
\-HUGE_VAL.
.PP
The \fBj0f()\fP etc. and \fBj0l()\fP etc. functions are versions that take
and return float and long double values, respectively.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The functions returning double conform to SVID 3, BSD 4.3, XPG4,
POSIX 1003.1-2001. The other functions are C99 requirements.
.SH BUGS
There are errors of up to 2e\-16 in the values returned by \fBj0()\fP,
\fBj1()\fP and \fBjn()\fP for values of \fIx\fP between \-8 and 8.
