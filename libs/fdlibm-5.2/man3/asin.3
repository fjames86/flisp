.SH NAME
asin, asinf, asinl \- arc sine function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double asin(double " x );
.sp
.BI "float asinf(float " x );
.sp
.BI "long double asinl(long double " x );  
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBasin()\fP function calculates the arc sine of \fIx\fP; that is
the value whose sine is \fIx\fP.  If \fIx\fP falls outside the range
\-1 to 1, \fBasin()\fP fails and \fIerrno\fP is set.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBasin()\fP function returns the arc sine in radians and the
value is mathematically defined to be between -PI/2 and PI/2
(inclusive).
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDOM
\fIx\fP is out of range.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899.
The float and long double variants are C99 requirements.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR acos (3),
.BR atan (3),
.BR atan2 (3),
.BR cos (3),
.BR sin (3),
.BR tan (3)
