.TH FREXP 3 2002-07-27 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
frexp, frexpf, frexpl \- convert floating-point number to fractional
and integral components
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double frexp(double " x ", int *" exp );
.sp
.BI "float frexpf(float " x ", int *" exp );
.sp
.BI "long double frexpl(long double " x ", int *" exp );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfrexp()\fP function is used to split the number \fIx\fP into a
normalized fraction and an exponent which is stored in \fIexp\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBfrexp()\fP function returns the normalized fraction.  If the
argument \fIx\fP is not zero, the normalized fraction is \fIx\fP
times a power of two, and is always in the range 1/2 (inclusive) to
1 (exclusive).  If \fIx\fP is zero, then the normalized fraction is
zero and zero is stored in \fIexp\fP.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899.
The float and the long double variants are C99 requirements.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <float.h>
int main () {
        double d = 2560;
        int e;
        double f = frexp(d, &e);
        printf("frexp(%g, &e) = %g: %g * %d^%d = %g\en",
               d, f, f, FLT_RADIX, e, d);
        return 0;
}
.fi
.sp
This program prints
.sp
.in +5
frexp(2560, &e) = 0.625: 0.625 * 2^12 = 2560
