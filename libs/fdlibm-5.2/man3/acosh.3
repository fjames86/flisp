.SH NAME
acosh, acoshf, acoshl \- inverse hyperbolic cosine function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double acosh(double " x );
.sp
.BI "float acoshf(float " x );
.sp 
.BI "long double acoshl(long double " x );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBacosh()\fP function calculates the inverse hyperbolic cosine of 
\fIx\fP; that is the value whose hyperbolic cosine is \fIx\fP.  If \fIx\fP 
is less than 1.0, \fBacosh()\fP returns not-a-number (NaN) and \fIerrno\fP 
is set.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDOM
\fIx\fP is out of range.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899.
The float and long double variants are C99 requirements.
