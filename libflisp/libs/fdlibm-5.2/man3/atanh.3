.SH NAME
atanh, atanhf, atanhl \- inverse hyperbolic tangent function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBatanh()\fP function calculates the inverse hyperbolic tangent of 
\fIx\fP; that is the value whose hyperbolic tangent is \fIx\fP.  If the
absolute value of \fIx\fP is greater than 1.0, \fBacosh()\fP returns 
not-a-number (NaN) and \fIerrno\fP is set.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDOM
\fIx\fP is out of range.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899.
The float and long double variants are C99 requirements.
