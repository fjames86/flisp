.SH NAME
hypot, hypotf, hypotl \- Euclidean distance function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double hypot(double " x ", double " y );
.sp
.BI "float hypotf(float " x ", float " y );
.sp
.BI "long double hypotl (long double " x ", long double " y );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hypot()
function returns
.RI sqrt( x * x + y * y ).
This is the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle
with sides of length
.I x
and
.IR y ,
or the distance of the point
.RI ( x , y )
from the origin.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, BSD 4.3, C99.
The float and the long double variants are C99 requirements.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR sqrt (3),
.BR cabs (3)
