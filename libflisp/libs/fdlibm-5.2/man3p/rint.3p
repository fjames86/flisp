.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall return the integral value (represented as a
\fBdouble\fP) nearest \fIx\fP in the direction of the
current rounding mode. The current rounding mode is implementation-defined.
.LP
If the current rounding mode rounds toward negative infinity, then
\fIrint\fP() shall be equivalent to \fIfloor\fP() . If the current
rounding mode rounds toward positive infinity, then \fIrint\fP() shall
be
equivalent to \fIceil\fP() .
.LP
These functions differ from the \fInearbyint\fP(), \fInearbyintf\fP(),
and \fInearbyintl\fP()
functions only in that they may raise the inexact floating-point exception
if the result differs in value from the argument.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the integer
(represented as a double precision number) nearest \fIx\fP
in the direction of the current rounding mode.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-0 or \(+-Inf, \fIx\fP shall be returned. 
.LP
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
and \fIrint\fP(), \fIrintf\fP(), and \fIrintl\fP() shall
return the value of the macro \(+-HUGE_VAL, \(+-HUGE_VALF, and \(+-HUGE_VALL
(with the same sign as \fIx\fP),
respectively. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions shall fail if:
.TP
Range\0Error
The result would cause an overflow. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.sp
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
