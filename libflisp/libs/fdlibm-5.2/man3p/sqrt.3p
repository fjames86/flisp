sqrt, sqrtf, sqrtl - square root function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <math.h>
.br
.sp
double sqrt(double\fP \fIx\fP\fB);
.br
float sqrtf(float\fP \fIx\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall compute the square root of their argument \fIx\fP,
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the square
root of \fIx\fP.
.LP
For finite values of \fIx\fP < -0, a domain error shall occur, and
\0either a NaN (if supported), or  \0an implementation-defined value
shall be returned.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-0 or +Inf, \fIx\fP shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is -Inf, a domain error shall occur, and either a NaN (if
supported), or an implementation-defined value shall be
returned. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions shall fail if:
.TP
Domain\0Error
The finite value of \fIx\fP is < -0,   \0or \fIx\fP is -Inf.  
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [EDOM]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the invalid floating-point exception shall be
raised.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Taking the Square Root of 9.0
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <math.h>
\&...
double x = 9.0;
double result;
\&...
result = sqrt(x);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
