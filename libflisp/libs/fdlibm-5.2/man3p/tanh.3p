.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall compute the hyperbolic tangent of their argument
\fIx\fP.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the hyperbolic
tangent of \fIx\fP.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-0, \fIx\fP shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-Inf, \(+-1 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is subnormal, a range error may occur and \fIx\fP should
be returned. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.TP
Range\0Error
The value of \fIx\fP is subnormal. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the underflow floating-point exception shall be
raised. 
.sp
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
