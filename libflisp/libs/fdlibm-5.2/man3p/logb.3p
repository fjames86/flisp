logb, logbf, logbl - radix-independent exponent
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall compute the exponent of \fIx\fP, which is the
integral part of log\fI_r\fP
|\fIx\fP|, as a signed floating-point value, for non-zero \fIx\fP,
where \fIr\fP is the radix of the machine's floating-point
arithmetic, which is the value of FLT_RADIX defined in the \fI<float.h>\fP
header.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is subnormal it is treated as though it were normalized;
thus for finite positive \fIx\fP:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB1 <=\fP \fIx\fP \fB* FLT_RADIX**-logb(x) < FLT_RADIX
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the exponent
of \fIx\fP.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-0, a pole error shall occur and \fIlogb\fP(), \fIlogbf\fP(),
and \fIlogbl\fP() shall return -HUGE_VAL,
-HUGE_VALF, and -HUGE_VALL, respectively.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions shall fail if:
.TP
Pole\0Error
The value of \fIx\fP is \(+-0. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception shall be
raised.

\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
