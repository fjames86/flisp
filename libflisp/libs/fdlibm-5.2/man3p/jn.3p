.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIj0\fP(), \fIj1\fP(), and \fIjn\fP() functions shall compute
Bessel functions of \fIx\fP of the first kind of orders
0, 1, and \fIn\fP, respectively.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the relevant
Bessel value of \fIx\fP of the first kind.
.LP
If the \fIx\fP argument is too large in magnitude, or the correct
result would cause underflow, 0 shall be returned and a range
error may occur.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.TP
Range\0Error
The value of \fIx\fP was too large in magnitude, or an underflow occurred.
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the underflow floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.sp
.LP
No other errors shall occur.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
