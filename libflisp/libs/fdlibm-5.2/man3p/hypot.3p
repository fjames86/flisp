.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
These functions shall compute the value of the square root of \fIx\fP**2+
\fIy\fP**2 without undue overflow or underflow.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the length
of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of
length \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP.
.LP
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
and \fIhypot\fP(), \fIhypotf\fP(), and \fIhypotl\fP()
shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP or \fIy\fP is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned (even if one
of \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP is NaN).
.LP
If \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP is NaN, and the other is not \(+-Inf, a NaN
shall be returned.
.LP
If both arguments are subnormal and the correct result is subnormal,
a range error may occur and the correct result is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions shall fail if:
.TP
Range\0Error
The result overflows. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the overflow floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.sp
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.TP
Range\0Error
The result underflows. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the underflow floating-point exception shall be
raised.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
\fIhypot\fP(\fIx\fP,\fIy\fP), \fIhypot\fP(\fIy\fP,\fIx\fP), and \fIhypot\fP(\fIx\fP,
-\fIy\fP) are equivalent.
.LP
\fIhypot\fP(\fIx\fP, \(+-0) is equivalent to \fIfabs\fP(\fIx\fP).
.LP
Underflow only happens when both \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are subnormal
and the (inexact) result is also subnormal.
.LP
These functions take precautions against overflow during intermediate
steps of the computation.
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
